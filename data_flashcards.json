Now run() is only defined in one place, which makes it much more maintainable, and when you need a Cat object, you can use a Cat object. When you need to work at a higher level, you can use the Animal object. We just abstracted what was common between the objects and prevented code duplication.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming</a>\r\n\r\n    ",

Calling speak() on the Dog object may elicit a bark(), and calling speak() on the Cat object may elicit a meow(). You may even have a Pig that implements IAnimal and calling speak() could elicit an oink() internally.\r\n\r\nYou could then create a generic List<IAnimal> and loop through all the animals, no matter what specific type they are, and call speak().

    "Answer": "MVVM is an architectural pattern that originated from Microsoft as a specialization of the Presentation Model design pattern introduced by Martin Fowler. It also has roots in the MVC pattern.\r\n\r\nMVVM was created to leverage features of WPF and Silverlight.\r\n\r\nThe <i>Model</i> contains the core information for an application. This includes the data and validation rules as well as data access and aggregation logic.\r\n\r\nThe <i>View</i> does a little bit more in MVVM than it does in MVC. It encapsulates the presentation of the application, but in WPF, that means it handles displaying all the visual elements (windows, buttons, images, etc.) as well as handling the keyboard shortcuts and other interaction controls that would typically be handled by a Controller in the MVC pattern.\r\n\r\nThe <i>ViewModel</i> is a 'Model of the View' meaning it is an abstraction of the View that also serves in data binding between the View and the Model. It typically contains properties used by the View for databinding.\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"#http://bit.ly/wiki-mvvm\">http://bit.ly/wiki-mvvm</a>\r\n\r\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"#http://bit.ly/wpf-mvvm\">http://bit.ly/wpf-mvvm</a>\r\n\r\n    ",

This allows differing behaviors while ensuring that the overarching algorithm is still followed.\r\n\r\nWhen you create a custom control in ASP.NET, you don't have to write any code to handle the functionality common to all controls, like loading and saving ViewState, allowing PostBack events to be handled, and raising the control lifecycle events in the correct order.

In traditional SDLC, you freeze the requirements, complete a full design, then start coding. In Agile, the developer does the design for one specific task just before he starts on it. In traditional SDLC, once the requirements and design have been signed off on, product owners are told, Okay, now nothing can change, but then things do change, and all the time you spent developing the full design up front is useless.
